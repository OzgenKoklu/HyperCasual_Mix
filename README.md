# This repository will contain different game projects for trending hypercasual sub-genres

I will try to document the tools I've used and also games I've developed. 

As I upload more Unity Projects in this repo, I will add gameplay clips & maybe webGL build links in this README document. 

This repo will be a showcase for my work and is for learning purposes. 

I'll only use free & CC0 assets/tools.
